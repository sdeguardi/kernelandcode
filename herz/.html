					</span>Complex Litigation</h2>
					<p>Joel Herz has a wealth of specialized subject-matter expertise. Yet, he is first and foremost a trial lawyer who strives to remain a generalist. Every case he handles presents a new and unique challenge to master complex factual scenarios. This approach has served our clients well by recovering tens of millions of dollars for businesses and individuals in a broad range of cases involving breaches of contract, business torts, unfair competition and environmental contamination, to name a few. We have represented businesses of every size, from some of the world's largest publicly traded companies, to individual proprietorships and have litigated complex disputes throughout the country.</p>

					  <i class="fa fa-leaf fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i>
					</span>Environmental Law and Litigation</h2>
					<p>Having been involved at more than 100 Superfund and other environmental sites throughout the country, we understand the nuances of the regulatory framework established under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and other federal and local environmental laws, allowing us to effectively litigate CERCLA, RCRA and toxic tort disputes, including those at Superfund sites. We also advise clients on environmental property issues including purchase, sale, and Brownfield issues, in addition to guiding businesses, developers, landowners and other clients through EPA and State enforcement and regulatory processes.</p>
